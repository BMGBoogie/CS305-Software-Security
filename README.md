Repository for CS305 Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

Artemis Financial was a company looking to advance their current systems and modernize, while ensuring that they maintain security across their platform. By utilizing a combination of static testing and manual review of the code, I was able to minimize the vulnerabilities found within the application and help protect the company in their new endeavours. In today's world, one of the most important characteristics a business has is its credibility and reputation. Software security helps minimize the risk of damaging a company's reputation through data breaches, and at most protects the data held within the system itself which could be anything from favorite candy to financial information.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

While the vulnerability assessment was completely new for me, I immediately saw the value in utilizing it for security. It takes some getting used to in terms of understanding how to read the report and what to do with the information, but once you build that comfort it is very easy to follow.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Utilizing the vulnerability report helps direct your focus towards the areas of opportunity within your program. Being given a sense of direction really helps in determining where to allot your focus and further develop security layers.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

By re-runing the vulnerability report, you are able to see if there were any new vulnerabilities that you exposed your application to after refactoring.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

There are numerous resources on the internet for programmers looking to assist each other. While I was able to utilize many of these resources such as stackoverflow to aid in a few issues I encountered, I was still unable to overcome my checksum verification issues.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I chose this work because it shows the proper utilization of the vulnerability report. Not only knowing how to run the report but also how to interpret the data and using it to make improvements in your application to avoid already identified opportunities further enhances the benefit of the report.
